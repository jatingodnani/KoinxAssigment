# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Assigment Overview=>
"In this assignment solution, I have utilized two APIs from CoinGecko:

Trending API: This API is used to display the top 15 trending coins.
Search by ID API: This API is employed to retrieve the INR and USD values of a specific coin.
Additionally, I have integrated a TradingView charting component. However, as there is no dedicated API available for each individual coin, the chart defaults to displaying Bitcoin's graph. Despite the lack of options, I've leveraged the Bitcoin graph to provide visualization within the solution."
